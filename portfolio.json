    "title": "DartScoreTracker: C++/Python Application for Recording Dart Scores",
    "description": "DartScoreTracker is an ongoing collaborative project. Our goal is to create a robust C++ application that leverages image processing techniques to automatically record scores on a dartboard. The application will be able to recognize the dartboard and the location of the darts, and then record the scores in a user-friendly interface. The application will also be able to keep track of the game state and provide statistics on the players' performance.",
